Build an image captioning AI using image recognition model which is VGG to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) which is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to generate captions for those images.
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network that is used for image recognition. This network is 16 layers deep. 
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a quantitative metric for measuring the quality of an output text based on multiple reference texts.
